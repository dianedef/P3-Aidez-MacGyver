# P3 - Help MacGyver
Â  This is the game corresponding to my project 3 on OpenClassrooms - Python program

* Install the game *

We assume here that you have Python 3 installed. The commands below must be launched in a terminal :

- The file must be launched in a virtual environment with Python 3: type "pipenv install" in your terminal to install the dependencies of the program (pygame in particular).
- Activate the virtual environment with "pipenv shell" in your terminal
- Start the game : type "python game_pygame.py" and press Enter. The game starts.

*The rules*

- You can move with the arrows on the keyboard
- You must collect all the items before you head for the exit, by walking though them
- You win if you go to the exit (where the keeper is!) after having collected all the items
- If you missed one or more items and go to the exit, you lose !
